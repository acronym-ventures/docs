**Individuals must meet specific eligibility criteria to use our Self-custody wallet (“Vault”) and services. If anyone who fails to meet the eligibility criteria still accesses the Vault or uses the services, they are violating our terms of service. In such cases, money, digital tokens, assets, or other items may be seized. We kindly ask that everyone follow these rules when using our services.**

These rules apply to people who use a website called account.acronym.exchange. It's essential to read these rules carefully to understand what they say. If you create an account, put money into it, or use any of the services offered on the Vault, you agree to follow these rules.

These Terms of Service are essential guidelines you should read before using our Vault. They include several documents that explain how we operate and what you can and cannot do on our Vault. These documents include the Risk Disclosure Statement and the Fees Schedule. You should also read our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.acronym.exchange/readme/privacy-policy), [Risk Disclosure Statement](https://docs.acronym.exchange/readme/risk-disclosure-statement) and [Cookies Policy](https://docs.acronym.exchange/readme/cookies-policy) which explain how we collect and use your personal information. It is important to note that we may charge fees for transactions involving Digital Tokens on or off the Vault, and these fees may change from time to time. In case of any confusion or conflict between these Terms of Service and other pages, policies, terms, conditions, licenses, limitations, or obligations on the Vault, these Terms of Service will be followed.

Please note that Acronym has the right to change, update, or modify the Terms of Service without prior notice. We suggest you check the Vault regularly to ensure you are aware of any changes. If you continue to use any of our Services after the effective date of any updates, changes, or amendments, you agree to the modified Terms of Service.

### **Acronym is a self-custody solution that allows you to hold and manage your digital tokens (cryptocurrency). You have complete control over your digital tokens via your private keys. Acronym does not store or have access to your digital tokens or private keys. Acronym is not responsible for lost access due to user negligence (forgotten passwords, lost seed phrases).**

Please note that you do not have any ownership or title of our Vault, services, or trademarks except for the limited license granted to you. If you violate our terms of service or pose a risk to our associates, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account, freeze your assets, or take other necessary actions.

## **2. User Accounts**

2.1. Creating an account as a user is necessary to utilize the Vault. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your login credentials, and for all activity under your Account.

2.3. As a regulated financial services company, we must identify all users for legal, regulatory, and compliance purposes before allowing them to use our Vault. To ensure compliance with applicable reporting requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we may collect and verify your personal information, including your legal name, address, government identification, and date of birth. We may also ask you questions and verify information ourselves or obtain personal information from third parties to verify your identity, prevent fraud, and request information from other entities like banks for information about you. 

   By agreeing to these terms, you certify, under penalty of perjury, that the information provided, including your legal name, address, government identification, and date of birth, is correct. You also agree that we may use your information to verify your identity.
   
   You acknowledge and agree that we may conduct necessary inquiries directly or through third parties to determine your identity. This includes requiring you to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments and verifying information against third-party databases or through other sources. These inquiries and verifications may involve sharing certain aspects of your information with third parties to complete these inquiries and verification.
   
2.4. Our commitment to protecting your privacy is a top priority. We understand that your personal information is sensitive and confidential, and we do not share it unless required by law or with your express consent. In situations where it is necessary to share your information with third parties to complete a transaction or prevent fraud, we will do so under our Privacy & Data Policy. Sharing information with law enforcement officials or other parties may prevent financial loss or a violation of the law. In that case, we may contact them and share details of any transactions you are associated with. For more information, please refer to our Privacy & Data Policy.

2.5. If you are creating an Account on behalf of a company, we require confirmation that you are an authorized entity officer and have the authority to enter into agreements for and on behalf of the company.

2.6. Our Vault is designed to support businesses that wish to engage in money transmission activities. However, you are responsible for ensuring that your company maintains the appropriate licenses, registrations, and permissions to perform such activities. The flow of funds in and out of your company's account held at Acronym must be solely for your company's account transactions and cannot be used for any activities facilitated by third parties using an Acronym wallet in your business' name. You must also maintain an anti-money laundering ("AML"), sanctions, and counter-terrorist financing ("CFT") policy/program that is reasonably designed to mitigate the risks of your business and meets the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which you operate. Please note that Acronym cannot provide regulatory, licensing, or compliance controls unless explicitly contracted under a separate agreement.

## **3. Acceptable Use**

3.1. We are pleased to grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use our Vault. The license is solely for informational, transactional, or other approved purposes. Please note that we reserve all rights in the Vault, including our websites, APIs, and other content. We understand that you have no other rights beyond this limited license. We assume that you agree not to copy, transmit, distribute, sell, resell, license, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify, publish, participate in the transfer or sale of, create derivative works from, perform, display, incorporate into another website, or in any other way exploit any content or other part of the Vault for any purpose. Additionally, you agree not to frame or display any part of the Vault without our prior written permission and not to use our trademarks without our permission.

3.2. Please be aware that any person may not use the Vault in any jurisdiction where its provision or use would violate applicable laws and regulations. If you reside in such a jurisdiction, we ask that you refrain from using the Vault in any manner that would violate any of its laws and regulations.

3.3. We remind you that you may only create, have, administer, and/or control one Account. You must first obtain our written permission if you require an additional Account. You may request an additional Account through our support contact form with the proposed purpose for an additional Account. We understand that we are under no obligation to approve any additional Account. Suppose we find that you have opened, operated, and/or are operating an additional Account or more than one Account at any one time without our permission. In that case, we reserve all rights, including but not limited to terminating your Account(s), revoking your limited license to use the Vault, and taking whatever other means we deem necessary to protect our users, us, and the Vault.

3.4. Please understand that your use of the Vault, or any part thereof, is at your sole risk, and we assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender. Suppose any third party files a claim for a chargeback, or we are otherwise informed of a dispute between you and another party. In that case, we are not responsible for intermediating, determining the veracity of claims, or resolving the conflict, including the disposition of any associated economic value of any assets.

## **4. Digital Assets and Vaults**

The Service may allow you to store, manage, and trade digital assets ("Digital Assets") through Acronym's Vault features. You understand that Digital Assets are volatile and speculative, and their value can fluctuate significantly. Acronym is not responsible for any losses you may incur due to fluctuations in their value.

**You acknowledge that Acronym is a non-custodial Vault and are solely not responsible for the security of your private keys and Digital Assets stored in your Vaults. Acronym cannot access your private keys and cannot recover lost or stolen Digital Assets.**

## **5. Third-Party Services**

5.1. Acronym may occasionally collaborate with third-party providers to offer services such as financial products in conjunction with the Acronym Vault. Acronym will adhere to applicable laws, regulations, and agreements with these providers and will furnish and update a list of pertinent financial service partners via the Vault. Acronym may be required to share your personal information with these providers to ensure they can provide services to Acronym. All personal information collection, sharing, and usage is subject to Acronym's Privacy & Data Policy.

5.2. You can link to third-party applications or content other parties make available through the Vault. By doing so, you grant Acronym express authorization to collaborate with third-party service providers, including SSO services and providers of financial products and services, to provide certain Vault functionality, including but not limited to the loading, transfer, conversion, and storage of funds. Before authorizing an application, we recommend carefully evaluating the purported functionality and the developer offering it. Unless otherwise stated, Acronym has no control over applications and assumes no responsibility for developers' actions.

5.3. Should you authorize a third-party application to connect to your Account and act on your behalf, you assume all risks associated with these connections and actions. Ultimately, you are accountable to Acronym for these connections and actions. Developers are expected to provide a support or dispute framework for their application, enabling the speedy resolution of any issues. However, if you have disputes with developers, you will need to address them directly with them.

5.4. This agreement states that you, as a user, agree not to hold us liable for any act or omission of any third party using your Account credentials, whether a developer or not. In addition, you agree to indemnify us against any liability arising from such acts or omissions. You may remove permissions granted to third parties concerning your Account at any time via your authorized applications page.

5.5. We specify that if a third party not affiliated with us provides you with access to market data and quotes to be used alongside our Vault, your use of the market data and quotes will be governed by the terms and conditions imposed by such third party.

5.6. We require you to represent and agree that the following statements are true and will remain true as long as you have access to our Vault:

   5.6.1. You will not use any information or market data from a national securities exchange or association for professional or commercial activities. If you intend to do so, you agree to notify us and pay any additional charges.
   
   5.6.2. You will not use the Vault in conjunction with any business as a broker-dealer, investment advisor, futures commission merchant, commodities introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, member of a securities exchange or association, or futures contract market, or as a owner, partner, or associated person of any of the foregoing.
   
   5.6.3. If you are employed by a bank, insurance company, or an affiliate of either, you will not perform functions related to securities or commodity futures trading activity except concerning your Account(s) with us.

## **6. Unsupported assets**

6.1 Acronym technology supports only cryptocurrencies and digital or virtual assets formally recognized with respect to the Vault. Any transfer of assets that Acronym technology does not support ("Unsupported Assets"), such as those received through initial coin offerings, forks, airdrops, user errors, or OMNI layer protocols, will not be accepted by Acronym on behalf of any user. Acronym reserves the right, at its discretion, to decline any value in exchange for such Unsupported Assets.

6.2 If third parties or users accidentally or intentionally send an Unsupported Asset to Acronym, it will be considered lost to that person. Acronym will treat any such Unsupported Assets as its property and dispose of them according to Acronym's policy. Acronym will not be responsible for recovering or returning any Unsupported Assets sent to the Vault, regardless of the sender's intentions or Acronym's attempts to return the assets. Acronym may decide to recover or provide value concerning Unsupported Assets solely at its discretion. Please visit our Transparency Page for an updated list of supported currencies and assets. Any asset that does not appear on the list is an Unsupported Asset.

6.3 Acronym reserves the right to list or delist any Asset at any time at its sole discretion. Suppose Acronym delists an Asset you hold, making it an Unsupported Asset. In that case, Acronym will make reasonable attempts to convert the Asset into another supported Asset of Acronym’s choosing at the prevailing market rates before delisting. Acronym will credit you with the value of the Unsupported Asset minus the conversion cost. Suppose Acronym cannot convert an Unsupported Asset into a supported Asset. In that case, you may lose the value of the Unsupported Asset due to legal or regulatory restrictions, lack of an available market, or other reasons.

## **7. Inactive accounts**

7.1. In the event you are holding funds in your Account, and Acronym has deemed the account inactive by no record of you transacting on the Vault for more than 90 days, applicable law states Acronym may be required to report these funds as unclaimed property to the State where your account is registered. If this occurs, Acronym will attempt to locate you via email and at the physical address on record; however, if Acronym cannot locate you, Acronym is not able to move your funds under any governing bodies behalf.

7.2. Acronym will attempt to communicate to you before your account becomes inactive that it will be debited if it remains inactive past the 90-day anniversary.

7.3. An account is considered inactive if the user initiates no transactions after 90 days. At its sole discretion, Acronym may close inactive accounts with zero balances. A transaction is considered any action in which value is moved and is initiated by a user within their Account, including a bank transfer (deposit or withdrawal), moving value between sub-accounts, or sending value to another user or crypto address.

7.4. To the extent required by law, if you leave a balance unused for the period set forth by your state, country, or other governing body in its unclaimed property laws, if you cancel your Account and leave a balance, or if we deactivate your Account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to reinstate it within 12 (12) months, we may close your Account and require you to reach out to support for further assistance with your funds.

## **8. Taxes**

8.1. As a user of our Vault, you must ensure that applicable taxes, duties, and fees associated with activities conducted through your Account are paid promptly. You must also assume responsibility for all taxes, including interest and penalties, which may be assessed under current or future laws concerning your Account. Additionally, it is incumbent upon you to report any proceeds of sale transactions and dividends paid through your Account to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the relevant legal stipulations.

8.2. Our Vault does not provide tax advice. As such, it is incumbent upon you to determine the tax implications associated with your use of the Vault and any transactions you may conduct through it. We strongly advise that you seek advice from a qualified accountant, lawyer, or tax authority in your jurisdiction to determine any tax consequences that may arise.

## **9. Electronic communications**

9.1. In compliance with the Terms and Conditions, Acronym may necessitate the delivery of legal and regulatory disclosures, periodic statements and confirmations, notices, and other communications ("Communications") in written form. By consenting to these Terms and Conditions, you authorize Acronym to provide such Communications electronically. This authorization for electronic delivery applies every year the statements are furnished. If you no longer have access to your account to receive the disclosures in electronic format, you may request the disclosures in written form.

9.2. In agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you further agree that all Communications from Acronym concerning your use of or access to the Vault, including customer support assistance that you may have requested regarding your account, may be provided or made accessible to you electronically by email, "in-app" messaging, or by posting a Communication on the Vault. You can access the Communications in the designated formats described below. Your consent to receive Communications, customer support assistance requested, and to conduct business electronically, as well as Acronym's agreement to do so, spans the entirety of your interactions and transactions with Acronym and its agents concerning your Vault usage and access.

9.3. Delivery of Electronic Communications shall be deemed to have taken place upon delivery in any of the following forms:

   9.3.1. Posting on your Account on our website or associated mobile application;
   
   9.3.2. Posting on a website or mobile application associated with us or the Vault;
   
   9.3.3. Sending via electronic mail to the email address you used to register for the Vault;
   
   9.4.4. Communicating via the Vault in any other manner.
      
9.4. The recipient is responsible for opening and reviewing all Communications delivered through the aforementioned methods. While the provider may notify the recipient of the Communication's availability, it is not obligated to do so. For example, the recipient may be informed of a Communication via a notification sent to their mobile device.

9.5. To ensure the receipt of all Communications, the recipient must keep their primary email address registered with the provider up to date. The provider will consider an electronic Communication to have been delivered to the recipient if it was sent but has yet to be received due to an incorrect, outdated, or blocked email address or any other reason. The recipient may update their primary email address and other contact information by submitting a support request or logging into the Vault and navigating to their profile.

9.6. If the recipient uses a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in their email address book, they may need to add the provider to their email address book to ensure the receipt of Communications.

9.7. Should you wish to request additional copies of communications or withdraw your consent, please consider the following additional terms:

   9.7.1. You may contact us or any relevant service provider to request another electronic copy of the communication, and we shall not impose a fee.
   
   9.7.2. If you require a paper copy of the electronic communication within 90 days of its original issuance, please note that we reserve the right to charge a fee for its provision.
   
   9.7.3. You may contact us to update the registration information we use for electronic communications or withdraw your consent to receive it.
   
   9.7.4. Please note that we retain the right to terminate your use of the Vault and any associated products and services should you decline or withdraw your consent to receive electronic communications.

## **10. Indemnification: Acronym rights and remedies**

10.1. The Acronym Vault's Terms and Conditions outline your indemnification responsibilities, your liability for any claims or damages arising from your use of the Vault, and the consequences of engaging in any prohibited business or use. You are obligated to indemnify and hold Acronym, its affiliates, and its representatives harmless from any damages, losses, expenses, and reasonable legal fees arising from a third-party claim related to your use of the Vault, including alleged violations of any laws, rules, or rights.

10.2. Stipulates that you are responsible for any claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liabilities incurred by Acronym or a third party due to any breach of the Terms and Conditions, any other user agreement, or your use of the Acronym Vault. You agree to reimburse Acronym or any third party for any such liabilities, fees, and expenses incurred in collecting such amounts.

## **11. Termination**

11.1. If a user discontinues using the Vault, they can cancel their Account as long as they are in good standing and in compliance with the Terms and Conditions and other policies. To cancel, they must withdraw all funds in their Account and visit our cancellation page. We may cancel or suspend any pending transactions and hold funds until any applicable reversal windows are complete. In addition, all obligations to us must be satisfied before we process the cancellation. We want to remind our users that Account cancellation cannot be used to avoid paying amounts due or if their activity is under investigation. If withdrawals are subject to minimum balances and users cannot cancel their accounts, they are encouraged to contact Acronym support for assistance.

11.2. Should we suspect that a user's Account is connected to any Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business, or if they violate the Terms and Conditions or any applicable agreements or policies, we reserve the right to terminate, suspend, or restrict their Account and use of the Vault. We may take such actions as required by applicable law or to prevent potential loss. We consider the use of the Vault a privilege and not a right. Therefore, we reserve the right to take any necessary measures to protect our users, Acronym, and Acronym's reputation.

11.3. In the event of an Account termination or if a user's Account is subject to verification requirements, they will generally be allowed to transfer funds of the Vault for thirty (30) days unless Acronym policies otherwise prohibit those transfers.
